# Team practices

## When merging PRs, use squash commits

When you merge a pull request, **use Squash Commits** before merging.

:::{note} Have a rationale if you don't want to follow this practice
If you _really want_ to use a Merge Commit, that's OK, but you should have a strong reason for why it's better to break with team guidelines before doing so.
For example, it is sometimes useful to use Merge Commits for certain bot or CI/CD workflows.
