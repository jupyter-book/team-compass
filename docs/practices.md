# Team practices

These are team practices that we try to follow across all repositories of `jupyter-book`.
They are not _strictly_ enforced, but we ask that you prioritize following them, and provide a clear rationale if you don't intend to.

## Shared Google Drive

We use a shared Google Drive to store documents, presentations, drafts, etc across our team.
The Steering Council has `manager` access to this shared drive.

There are two folders inside:

- [This is a folder for the broader Jupyter Book team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tfa2-LHeHJ61YZsRSHo4dszTKluHAME5?usp=drive_link). All Jupyter Book team members should have access. This should have all resources other than things that are too sensitive to share across the team.
- [This is a folder for the Steering Council only](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GFKrOrPoiD9bFRbDqFu5OeU8AicSuWSn?usp=drive_link). Only Steering Council members should have access. This should be restricted to sensitive information that isn't appropriate for full team access (e.g., CoC or HR discussions).

:::{note} We plan to move this to a Jupyter shared drive
See [this GitHub issue tracking this effort](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1126188960666882088/1382444773348085943).

## When merging PRs, use squash commits

When you merge a pull request, **use Squash Commits** before merging.

:::{note} Have a rationale if you don't want to follow this practice
If you _really want_ to use a Merge Commit, that's OK, but you should have a strong reason for why it's better to break with team guidelines before doing so.
For example, it is sometimes useful to use Merge Commits for certain bot or CI/CD workflows.
