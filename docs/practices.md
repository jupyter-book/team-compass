# Team practices

These are team practices that we try to follow across all repositories of `jupyter-book`.
They are not _strictly_ enforced, but we ask that you prioritize following them, and provide a clear rationale if you don't intend to.

## Share notes and materials in our team drive

We use a [shared Google Drive](#team-drive) to make it easier for us to re-use the same content, and to have shared spaces for notes. We encourage you to use this space to facilitate collaboration and sharing!

## When merging PRs, use squash commits

When you merge a pull request, **use Squash Commits** before merging.

:::{note} Have a rationale if you don't want to follow this practice
If you _really want_ to use a Merge Commit, that's OK, but you should have a strong reason for why it's better to break with team guidelines before doing so.
For example, it is sometimes useful to use Merge Commits for certain bot or CI/CD workflows.
