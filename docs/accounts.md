# Accounts and services

This page describes various accounts and services that our team uses, and how to access them.

## Shared Google Drive

We use a shared Google Drive to store documents, presentations, drafts, etc across our team.
The Steering Council has `manager` access to this shared drive.

There are two folders inside:

- [This is a folder for the broader Jupyter Book team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tfa2-LHeHJ61YZsRSHo4dszTKluHAME5?usp=drive_link). All Jupyter Book team members should have access. This should have all resources other than things that are too sensitive to share across the team.
- [This is a folder for the Steering Council only](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GFKrOrPoiD9bFRbDqFu5OeU8AicSuWSn?usp=drive_link). Only Steering Council members should have access. This should be restricted to sensitive information that isn't appropriate for full team access (e.g., CoC or HR discussions).

:::{note} We plan to move this to a Jupyter shared drive
See [this GitHub issue tracking this effort](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1126188960666882088/1382444773348085943).

## Google groups

We have two Google groups to standardize our team's access to various tools in the Jupyter ecosystem, and as a space for conversation within a group.

- `jupyter-book-council@jupyter.org` - All steering council members.
- `jupyter-book-team@jupyter.org` - All team members.

## Google calendar

We have [a Google calendar](#calendar) for organizing our events. This exists under the Project Jupyter Google Workspace.
