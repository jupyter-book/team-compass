# Facilitator Checklist for Collaboration Cafes

This document provides a list of actions for a facilitator to take, and when, when running a Collaboration Cafe.[^thanks] These aren't rules to follow, but guidelines to make it easier for anybody to serve in this role.

[^thanks]: Thanks to the [JupyterHub Collaboration Cafe facilitator checklist](https://compass.hub.jupyter.org/meetings/collab-cafe/facilitator-checklist/) for heavy inspiration.

## Before the Meeting

## During the Meeting

```{tip} Jitsi tip
If you join the jitsi link a few minutes before the meeting starts, you'll see a "Waiting for the Moderator to start the meeting" message. You can claim moderator status by signing in (using GitHub will suffice). You can then manage breakout rooms and such.
```

- Welcome everyone and remind them that the meeting is being held under [Jupyter's Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).
- Follow [the collaborative notes document](https://hackmd.io/@jupyter-book/collaboration-cafe). Do your best to help the group follow the structure of the collaborative notes and agenda.
