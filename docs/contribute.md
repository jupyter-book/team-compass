# Contribute and join

We're an open source community that welcomes contributions from others.
Here are a few resources to help you get started interacting with our team and community, and making contributions to our projects.

## Is my contribution welcome?

Absolutely! We welcome contribution from anyone, and want others to become contributors, maintainers, and leaders of this project. Please be patient - we also rely on volunteer labor, so we aren't always as responsive as we'd like to be. We promise to do our best!

## Events and meetings

The [Jupyter Book Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/4?cid=Y184YWIxNzY1YjY1ODY3NDVkOGI3NWU5MmJkYzdjYTZlNDZjYWExMmE1ZjhkOTUwZDVmNzNmMzI2Zjk3NjE0NGQ3QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) has a list of all Jupyter Book team meetings.

### Monthly collaboration cafes

Collaboration cafes are a way for any member of the Jupyter Book community to remotely get together to share what they've been up to, have discussions, and work together. You are welcome to join as long as you're interested in Jupyter Book!

See [the Jupyter Book Collaboration Cafe notes](https://hackmd.io/A5lovhm4TFOYGqD59jhfCw) for more details and meeting notes.
