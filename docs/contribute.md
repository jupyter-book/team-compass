# Contribute and join

We're an open source community that welcomes contributions from others.
Here are a few resources to help you get started interacting with our team and community, and making contributions to our projects.

## Is my contribution welcome?

Absolutely!
We welcome contribution from anyone, and want others to become contributors, maintainers, and leaders of this project.
Please be patient - we also rely on volunteer labor, so we aren't always as responsive as we'd like to be.
We promise to do our best!
