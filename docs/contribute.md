# Contribute and join

We're an open source community that welcomes contributions from others.
Here are a few resources to help you get started interacting with our team and community, and making contributions to our projects.

## Is my contribution welcome?

Absolutely! We welcome contribution from anyone, and want others to become contributors, maintainers, and leaders of this project. Please be patient - we also rely on volunteer labor, so we aren't always as responsive as we'd like to be. We promise to do our best!

## Events and meetings

### Monthly collaboration cafes

Collaboration cafes are a way for members of the Jupyter Book community to remotely get together to share what they've been up to, have discussions, and work together.

The Jupyter Book team is piloting an [experiment to join the JupyterHub Team Collaboaration Cafes][expt]. These are open to anyone, and are a way to discuss and work together across these projects.

If you'd like to connect with our team, check out the meeting schedule in <xref:blog#schedule> consider joining. We can't promise that we'll attend each one, but will do our best!
