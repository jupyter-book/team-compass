## Steering council

The steering council are the primary stewards of the Jupyter Book project and community.
They set organizational policy and strategy, make decisions when we are at an impasse, and delegate power to others in the organization.

### Mailing list

The Steering Council uses a **Mailing List** for its internal and external communication.
Anybody may message this list to get in touch with the Steering Council as a whole.

The Steering Council Mailing List is: [**`jupyter-book-council@googlegroups.com`**](mailto:jupyter-book-council@googlegroups.com).

The Jupyter Project asks each sub-project to delegate one team member to serve as representative to the [Software Steering Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html).

We plan for this to be a role that rotates through the team, with a roughly one-year cycle.
It can be any of the [core team members](#core-team).
