## Goals of the Team Compass

The Team Compass should make our organizational policy, structure, and team practices explicit.
It also delegates authority to other groups, processes, and locations.
See the sections below for more information.[^1]

[^1]: A Team Compass is common in the Jupyter ecoystem (e.g., [here is JupyterHub's Team Compass](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index-team_guides.html)). In fact, Jupyter's governance model will soon [require that sub-projects have their own Team Compass](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html?responsibilities-of-jupyter-subprojects)
